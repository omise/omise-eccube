# CHANGELOG

### v2.1 _(February 28, 2017)_

#### ðŸ‘¾ Bug Fixes

- Validate a charge result before update an order status (PR [#9](https://github.com/omise/omise-eccube/pull/9))

> note, we were changed our versioning structure from `[platform-major].[platform-minor].[plugin-major].[plugin-minor]` to `[platform-major].[plugin-major]`.  
> So, this update was made base on EC-Cube 2.x series with second release (the first one is v2.13.0.0 = 2.0). So, this release will release under version 2.1

#### âœ¨ Highlights
